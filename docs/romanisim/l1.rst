Making L1 images
================

An L1 (level 1) image is a "raw" image received from the detectors.  The actual measurements made on the spacecraft consist of a number of non-destructive reads of the pixels of the H4RG detectors.  These reads have independent read noise but because the pixels count the total number of photons having entered each pixel, the Poisson noise in different reads of the same pixel is correlated.

Because the telescope has limited bandwidth, every read is not transferred to ground stations.  Instead, reads are averaged into "resultants" according to a specification called a MultiAccum table, and these resultants are transferred, archived, and analyzed.  These resultants make up an L1 image, which romanisim simulates.

L1 images are created using an idealized ``counts`` image described :doc:`here </romanisim/image>`, which contains the number of photons each pixel of the detector would receive absent any instrumental systematics.  To transform this into an L1 image, these counts must be apportioned into reads and averaged into resultants, and instrumental effects must be added.

This process proceeds by simulating each read, drawing the appropriate number of photons from the total number of photons for each read following a binomial distribution.  These photons are added to a running sum that is then averaged into a resultant according to the MultiAccum table specification.  This process requires drawing random numbers from the binomial distribution for every read of every pixel, and so can take on the order of a minute, but it allows detailed simulation of the statistics of the noise in each resultant together with their correlations.  It also makes it straightforward to add various instrumental effects into the simulation accurately, since these usually apply to individual reads rather than to resultants (e.g., cosmic rays affect individual reads, and their affect on a resultant depends on the read in the resultant to which they apply).

After apportioning counts to resultants, systematic effects are added to the resultants.  Presently only read noise is added.  The read noise is averaged down like :math:`1/\sqrt{N}`, where :math:`N` is the number of reads contributing to the resultant.

Nonlinearity
------------

Non-linearity is considered when L1 images are constructed and a non-linearity model is provided (e.g., from CRDS).  Non-linearity is implemented by including an additional "efficiency" parameter that is the linearity-affected count rate divided by the idealized count rate absent nonlinearity; this is the reciprocal of the derivative of the non-linearity correction function.  Two complications arise:

1. We need to keep track of the number of counts lost due to non-linearity, so we don't apportion them to future reads.
2. The efficiency varies over each read; ignoring this effect and using only the efficiency at the start of each reach can lead to 1-2% biases depending on how quickly the efficiency changes with flux.

To address (1), we adjust the probability of the number of counts we draw from the binomial distribution to effectively remove the lost photons from the count.  To mitigate (2), we compute the efficiency for each read based on a guess for what the efficiency will be at the midpoint of the read, after half the charges have been accumulated, based on the idealized count rate for the pixel and the efficiency of the last read.  One could imagine a higher order scheme to do better here, but this reduced the errors to <0.5 mmag.

Note that this picture of nonlinearity is that the pixels are not recording all of the photons in the presence of nonlinearity.  Another picture is that the effective gain changes---i.e., the relationship between recorded counts and photons---but that the Poisson statistics on the number of photons should be consistent with having counted all of the photons.  That's not what the code is doing at the moment, though it's straightforward.

Interpixel Capacitance
----------------------

Interpixel capacitance (IPC) is added following non-linearity and before read-out.  Read noise remains independent among different pixels but the Poisson noise is correlated between pixels by the IPC.  We simply convolve the resultants by a 3x3 kernel after apportioning counts to resultants and applying non-linearity but before adding read noise.

This is slightly different than including IPC in the PSF kernel because including IPC in the PSF kernel leaves the Poisson noise uncorrelated.
