"""Convert images into L1 images, with ramps.

We imagine starting with an image that gives the total number of counts from
all Poisson processes (at least: sky, sources, dark current).  We then need
to redistribute these counts over the resultants of an L1 image.

The easiest thing to do, and probably where I should start, is to sample the
image read-by-read with a binomial draw from the total counts weighted by the
chance that each count landed in this particular time window.  Then gather
those for each resultant and average, as done on the spacecraft.

It's tempting to go straight to making the appropriate resultants.  Following
Casertano (2022?), the variance in each resultant is:

.. math:: V = \\sigma_{read}^2/N + f \\tau

where f is the count rate, N is the number of reads in the resultant, and :math:`\\tau`
is the 'variance-based resultant time'

.. math:: \\tau = 1/N^2 \\sum_{reads} (2 (N - k) - 1) t_k

where the t_k is the time of the kth read in the resultant.

For uniformly spaced reads,

.. math:: \\tau = t_0 + d (N/3 + 1/6N - 1/2) \\, ,

where t_0 is the time of the first read in the resultant and d is the spacing
of the reads.

So that gives the variance from Poisson counts in resultant.  But how should
we draw random numbers to get that variance and the right mean?  I can
separately control the mean and variance by scaling the Poisson distribution,
but I'm not sure that's doing the right thing with the higher order moments.

It probably isn't that expensive to just work out all of the reads,
individually, which will also allow more natural incorporation of
cosmic rays down the road.  So let's take that approach instead for
the moment.

How do we want to specify an L1 image?  An L1 image is defined by a
total count image and a list of lists :math:`t_{i, j}`, where
:math:`t_{i, j}` is the time at which the jth read in the ith
resultant is made.  We demand :math:`t_{i, j} > t_{k, l}`
whenever i > k or whenever i = k and j > l.

Things this doesn't allow neatly:

* jitter in telescope pointing: the rate image is the same for each read/resultant
* non-linearity?
* weird non-linear systematics in darks?

Possibly some systematics need to be applied to the individual reads, rather than to
the final image.  e.g., clearly nonlinearity?  I need to think about when in the chain
things like IPC, etc., come in.  But it still seems correct to first generate the total
number of counts that an ideal detector would measure from sources, and then apply
these effects read-by-read as we build up the resultants---i.e., I expect the current
framework will be able to handle this without major issue.

This approach is not super fast.  For a high latitude set of resultants,
generating all of the random numbers to determine the apportionment takes
43 s on the machine I'm currently using; this will scale linearly with the
number of reads.  That's longer than the actual image production for the
dummy scene I'm using (though only ~2x longer).

I don't have a good way to speed this up.  Explicitly doing the Poisson
noise on each read from a rate image (rather than the apportionment of an
image that already has Poisson noise) is 2x slower---generating billions
of random numbers just takes a little while.

Plausibly I could figure out how to draw numbers directly from what a
resultant is rather than looking at each read individually.  That would
likely bring a ~10x speed-up.  The read noise there is easy.  The
poisson noise is a sum of scaled Poisson variables:

.. math:: \\sum_{i=0, ..., N-1} (N-i) c_i \\, ,

where :math:`c_i` is a Poisson-distributed variable.
The sum of Poisson-distributed variables is Poisson-distributed, but I wasn't
immediately able to find anything about the sum of scaled Poisson-distributed
variables.  The result is clearly not Poisson-distributed, but maybe there's
some special way to sample from that directly.

If we did sample from that directly, we'd still also need to get the sum
of the counts in the reads comprising the resultant.  So I think you'd need
a separate draw for that, conditional on the number you got for the resultant.
Or, reversing that, you might want to draw the total number of counts first,
e.g., via the binomial distribution, and then you'd want to draw a number
for what the average number of counts was among the reads comprising the
resultant, conditional on the total number of counts.  Then

.. math:: \\sum_{i=0, ..., N-1} (N-i) c_i

is some kind of statistic of the multinomial distribution.  That sounds a
little more tractable?

.. math:: c_i \\sim \\mathrm{multinomial}(\\mathrm{total}, [1/N, ..., 1/N])

We want to draw from :math:`\\sum (N-i) c_i`.
I think the probabilities are always :math:`1/N`, with the possible small but
important
exception of 'skipped' or 'dropped' reads, in which case the first read would
be more like :math:`2/(N+1)` and all the others :math:`1/(N+1)`.  If the probabilities
were always 1/N, this looks vaguely like it could have a nice analytic
solution.  Otherwise, I don't immediately see a route forward.  So I am not
going to pursue this avenue further.
