"""Roman bandpass routines

The primary purpose of this module is to provide the number of counts
per second expected for sources observed by Roman given a source with
the nominal flat AB spectrum of 3631 Jy.  The ultimate source of this
information is https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/WFI_technical.html .

# we need to multiply by a constant determined by the AB magnitude
# system and the shape of the Roman bands.
