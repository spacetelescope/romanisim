"""Routines to handle non-linearity in simulating ramps.

The approach taken here is straightforward.  The detector is accumulating
photons, but the capacitance of the pixel varies with flux level and so
the mapping between accumulated photons and read-out digital numbers
changes with flux level.  The CRDS linearity and inverse-linearity reference
files describe the mapping between linear DN and observed DN.  This module
implements that mapping.  When simulating an image, the photons entering
each pixel are simulated, and then before being "read out" into a buffer,
are transformed with this mapping into observed counts.  These are then
averaged and emitted as resultants.

    This function replaces suspicious-looking non-linearity coefficients with

    correction.
